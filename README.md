## Introduction
It's debatable is an online debate platform where users can debate with their friends and family. They can have debate on existing debate topics or they can create their own debate topics. Users can also see their ongoing debates, ended debates, debates which are waiting to be started, etc.

Once both participants join the debate room, participant 1 can start the debate. Each participant will get 30 seconds to defend their side. Debates arguments can be translated in 5 different laguages namely Chinese, English, German, Greek, Spanish. 

If second participant joined as a guest user, they do not have any access to any feature of It's debatable except participanting on the debate they have invited to. However, they do have right to end the debate.

## Technologies
We used Java in the backend of It's debatable i.e. in this repository. The other frameworks which we used in backend are Spring, Rest, Heroku (for deployment), SonarCloud (code quality). We used Deepl api for translation. We used Javascript, HTML, CSS, SCSS and React for [It's debatable Client](https://github.com/sopra-fs22-group-19/Debatable_Client). We had weekly Scrums and the implementation period was divided into 2 sprints.

## High-level Components
## Launch & Deployment

## Illustrations
Users can either login or register to the platform. They will see a home page. Users can join the debates using exiting debate topis as shown in the image below:

Users can also create a new debate topic using Create debate in the navigation bar.

Once users join the debate from topics, they will be redirected to debate room. Where they will see a invite button to invite second participant for the debate. They need to send the link to second participant. Second participant can join the debate by either login, register, or join as a guest. If user joins as guest, they don't have access to anything other than participating on that particular debate. Once second participant join, first participant can start the debate. Once the debate started, it will be chance of first participant to write their argument in 30 seconds time period. Participants can either post their answers by clicking enter button in their keyboard or clicking send button. If participant could not post their argument in 30 seconds, argument will posted automatically after 30 seconds.

## Roadmap
Following are some features which would be nice additions:
### Debate viewers
It would be a nice addition to add viewers who can watch the debates.

### Debate Winner
Currently, there is no winner of the debates. Using the above feature and by upvoting and downvoting the arguments, debate winner can be decided.

### Debate Moderator
It would be nice if we can have a debate moderator who can try to keep the debating participants stick to the topic and can stop them from deviating.

### Live video mode of debating
In the current implementation, users type their arguments in the debate room. It would be nicer to have debates with people on live video mode.
